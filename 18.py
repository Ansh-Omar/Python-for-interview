 Write a Python Program to Print the Fibonacci sequence.
 Fibonacci sequence:
 The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two
 preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins with 0 and 1, and
 the next number is obtained by adding the previous two numbers. This pattern continues
 indefinitely, generating a sequence that looks like this:
 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.
 Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined using the following recurrence
 relation:
 𝐹(0) = 0 𝐹(1) = 1 𝐹(𝑛) = 𝐹(𝑛−1)+𝐹(𝑛−2)𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑛 > 1'''

# Fibonacci Sequence

a=int(input("Enter limit : "))
b=0;c=1
print(b,c,sep=",",end=",")
for x in range (1,a+1):
    c,b=b+c,c
    print(c,end=",")
